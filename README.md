# Just Refs

Welcome to Just Refs - The Naked Wikipedia

Live Demo: <https://getitdaily.com/justrefs/>

Github Repository: <https://github.com/attogram/justrefs>

## Goal

The goal of the project is to help students and researchers by offering a list of reference links and a list of related topics extracted from any topic on the English Wikipedia.

This removes the distraction of the prose written by others, and allows you to concentrate exclusively on judging the quality of the references.
